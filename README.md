# Metagenomics & more

With this repository I want to provide information on metagenomic data analysis. That means that I will create posts in this repository on how to analyze 16s rRNA amplicons or shotgun metagenomic datasets. In addition, I give pointers to software application and pipelines that could be useful for other as well.
